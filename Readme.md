# Student Performance Prediction

This project uses a linear regression model to predict student performance based on various features from a dataset. The dataset is provided in the `student-mat.csv` file, and the model is implemented in the `student_perfomace.py` script.

## Files

- `student_perfomace.py`: The main script that reads the dataset, preprocesses the data, trains the linear regression model, and evaluates its performance.
- `student-mat.csv`: The dataset containing student performance data and various features.

## Usage

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:
```sh
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
```
